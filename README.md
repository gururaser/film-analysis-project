# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization of Films from 1980-2020

This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis and data visualization of films produced between 1980-2020. The project aims to analyze and explore the relationships between various features of the films, such as the genre, rating, budget, gross, director, writer, and runtime.

By conducting exploratory data analysis, we can identify trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset, which can then be visualized using various data visualization techniques such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms. This will help to better understand the characteristics of the films produced during this period, and enable us to make predictions about future films.
